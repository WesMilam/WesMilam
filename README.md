👋 Hi, I’m Dr. Wes Milam (@DrWesMilam)

🔍 I'm passionate about data science, predictive analytics, MLOps, Generative AI, and software development.

🎓 I hold a Doctor of Science in Information Technology. My original research developed an AI acceptance model incorporating cognitive dissonance theory in tech adoption.

🧠 I’m driven by curiosity and the belief that adaptability beats specialization in a fast-changing tech landscape.

🛠️ I love solving complex problems across diverse ecosystems, languages, and tools.

📫 Want to connect? Tag me and I’ll respond—can’t always post contact details publicly.

💡 Philosophy
"Don’t chase the hottest stack. Learn fast, build smart, and question everything."
