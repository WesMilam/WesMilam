- 👋 Hi, I’m @WesMilam
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis, automation, and learning new ways to do these things.
- 🌱 I will finish my MS in Data Science this fall. Currently working in automation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on scripting projects. Python, PowerShell, R, JavaScript, Tableau, PowerBI, data cleaning techniques, it all interests me. :)
- 📫 Reach me? I can't put to much out there, but @ me and I will get back.
